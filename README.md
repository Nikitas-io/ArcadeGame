# Arcade Game Project

I made use of **object-oriented** JavaScript with class prototype functions to recreate the classic frogger game. The user can navigate their character on screen to avoid animated enemies in order to get from the bottom of the screen to the top.

## Run the game

To run the game simply load the project's folder on a localhost and open the index.html file.

## Play the game

To play the game simply navigate the charachter with the up, down, left and right arrows. The game will end once you cross to the water, where you can restart the game to infinity.

### Outside code source

I used this snipet from [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5915096/get-random-item-from-javascript-array) to help me get random items from an array.
